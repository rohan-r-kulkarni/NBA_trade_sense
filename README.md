# NBA_trade_sense
Using Markov Decision Processes to model player performance and trades in the NBA in order to assist GMs better manage teams. By framing the player trading problem within a Partially- Observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDPs) framework, we aim to provide valuable insights into the dynamics of player trades, equipping GMs with a data-driven tool to navigate the complex landscape of trade decision-making in the NBA.

This repository contains the code that is used to aggregate and compile data, visualize metrics, build the transition matrix and reward schemes for the POMDP, simulate the POMDP and generate our EV functions, as well as visualize our results.
